I am happy to be here and learn the history, nature and culture of Russia. Christopher Mack Quiroa Hello everyone, my name is Farhan Ramadan, I came from Indonesia.

I study not only the Russian language, but also history, social sciences, and economics. These subjects help me not only speak Russian better, but also better understand culture. Of course, it is not enough to study Russian only in the classroom, you also need to listen and speak more Russian. Here I will study translating at the magistracy. If I achieve my goal, I will become competitive at the labor market, this is both a challenge and an opportunity. Li Danyang Hello, my name is Nechirvan Salih. I came here from Northern Iraq to study. I heard that Kazan University is one of the best in Russia, so I decided to enroll here. I studied at the preparatory school for 9 months, it was very interesting: my first experience in Russia, studying, getting to know good and kind people. Nechirvan Salih My name is Nur Zad Ahmad, I am from Afghanistan. I have already graduated from a university in my homeland with a degree in Civil Engineering. I began to study Russian 8 months ago at the preparatory school and now I speak Russian quite well. In addition, I made many new friends. Here I can get good knowledge in my specialty. I chose the city of Kazan, because Kazan is one of the largest and most advanced cities in Russia, Kazan University is one of the 10 leading universities in Russia, and the teachers here are excellent specialists. Nur Zad Ahmad Hello, my name is Ren Ningbo, in September I came to Kazan from China. For me, studying at the preparatory school is very interesting and useful. At the first classes in the Russian language, I did not understand everything, it was especially difficult in the classes on the history of Russia, mathematics and social studies. Every day I tried to learn new words and new grammar. Time passed quickly, and I began to get acquainted with foreign and Russian students to communicate. In addition to classes, there is a lot of interesting things at the prep-school, for example, the «round table» events, when students from different groups sit down together and discuss current issues. I think this is a very good way to make new friends and learn to speak good Russian. I really thank my teacher and curator, as she helped me a lot. Ren Ningbo Hello, my name is Sunbuli Khetam, I am from the Syrian Arab Republic. When I arrived in Russia, I was familiar with some Russian words. Here, teachers begin to teach students the Russian language from the letters. It was amazing to me that after a month and a half I was able to understand conversations in Russian and even participate in them. This is how we study at the prep-school: at the first semester we study Russian more, and at the second we begin to study our majors, we even have interesting work at the laboratory. In addition, the students’ concerts often take place, where all students can participate. Also there are a lot of sporting events in the sports capital of Russia: I, for example, participated in a health marathon. Sunbuli Khetam Hello! My name is Gesh Miatelana, I came from Congo. When I arrived in Russia, I opened a new page in my life. Of course, it was difficult to adapt to weather conditions, and life here is more expensive than at home. The next problem is language. In the first semester, it was very difficult for me to answer even a simple question. But now everything is fine, I’m used to it, I really like the city of Kazan and Kazan University, here we have everything we need for study. There are great teachers who teach us well. At the end, I want to thank you all for what you are doing for us. Gesh Miatelana My name is Chipego Shasokwe, I am from Zambia. Currently I’m studying at the Preparatory School for international students of the Kazan federal University. Later I’m going to study general medicine, because it always was my passion, I love to be a doctor, I love to help people. At the Preparatory faculty we have biology, physics. Chemistry, professional communication in Russian language and the Russian language. My favorite classes are Russian language classes and biology, because my teachers are very nice. If you are looking for a school in Russia I advice you to come to Kazan Federal University because is the best place. The place is peaceful, quiet, it’s beautiful to walk around, it’s so much to see, so many beautiful architecture. So even if you want to come as tourist is going to be a very good idea.
